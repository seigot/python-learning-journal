West Valley College — Advanced Python Class Vocabulary List (Week 2/2)

Programming Fundamentals
- Recursion — A method of solving problems where a function calls itself
- Iteration — Repeating processing using loops
- Base Case — The terminating condition that stops recursion
- Recursive Case — The part that reduces the problem and calls the function again
- Call Stack — A memory structure that keeps track of function call history
- Stack Overflow — A state where memory is exhausted due to excessively deep recursion
- Divide & Conquer — A strategy that solves problems by splitting them into smaller parts

Object-Oriented Concepts
- Polymorphism — The ability to apply the same operation to different types
- Method Overloading — Defining functions with the same name but different arguments (generally not supported natively in Python)
- Attribute Error — An error when accessing a non-existent member
- Duck Typing — A Python design approach that focuses on behavior rather than type

Search Algorithms
- DFS (Depth First Search) — A strategy that explores deeply before backtracking
- Backtracking — Returning when hitting a dead end and trying another path
- Maze Solving — A typical example of grid-search problems
- Boundary Checking — Verifying to prevent out-of-range access
- Visited Tracking — Recording visited states to avoid revisiting

Binary Search
- Binary Search — A search method that repeatedly halves the search range
- Midpoint — The central comparison reference of the search range
- Low / High Bounds — The endpoints of the search range

Search Space Reduction — Eliminating unnecessary regions
- Log Complexity — Rapid reduction in logarithmic time
- Data Structures & Representation
- 2D Array — A matrix-like data structure

Grid Representation — Representing space using arrays
- Index Navigation — Manipulating coordinates within arrays
- Boolean Result — Designing functions to return true/false outcomes

Implementation & Lab Related
- Path Marking — Recording the solution path in an array
- Testing/Debugging — Verifying behavior and fixing issues
- Code Commenting — Adding annotations to improve readability
- Demo Presentation — Demonstrating and explaining the solution
